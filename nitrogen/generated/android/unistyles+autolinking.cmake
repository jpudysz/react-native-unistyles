# This is a CMake file that adds all files generated by Nitrogen
# to the current CMake project.
#
# To use it, add this to your CMakeLists.txt:
# ```cmake
# include(${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/../nitrogen/generated/android/unistyles+autolinking.cmake)
# ```

# Add all headers that were generated by Nitrogen
include_directories(
  "../nitrogen/generated/shared/c++"
  "../nitrogen/generated/android/c++"
)

# Add all .cpp sources that were generated by Nitrogen
target_sources(
  # CMake project name (Android C++ library name)
  unistyles PRIVATE
  # Shared Nitrogen C++ sources
  ../nitrogen/generated/shared/c++/HybridNavigationBarSpec.cpp
  ../nitrogen/generated/shared/c++/HybridStatusBarSpec.cpp
  ../nitrogen/generated/shared/c++/HybridUnistylesRuntimeSpec.cpp
  # Android-specific Nitrogen C++ sources
  
)

# Add all libraries required by the generated specs

find_package(ReactAndroid REQUIRED) # <-- Used to set up React Native bindings (e.g. CallInvoker/TurboModule)
find_package(react-native-nitro-modules REQUIRED) # <-- Used to create all HybridObjects and use the Nitro core library

# Link all libraries together
