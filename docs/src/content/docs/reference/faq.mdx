Here, you can find answers to the most frequently asked questions about Unistyles.

### Why Unistyles runtime is not available?

This error occurs when you try to use a Unistyles feature without proper installation.

Possible causes include:
- Running the app in Expo Go, which is not supported.
- Running your Expo project without rebuilding it using the `expo prebuild` command
- Forgetting to execute `pod install` in your bare React Native project
- Omitting the import of the file where you set up your UnistylesRegistry eg. in your `App.tsx` file

### I'm trying to override library types, but I'm receiving error that react-native-unistyles is not found?

To override types, you must import something from `react-native-unistyles`, such as `UnistylesRegistry`.

### Adaptive mode doesn't work for me

To enable adaptive mode, you need to register two themes named `light` and `dark` and set the `adaptiveThemes` flag to true within `UnistylesRegistry`.

If your app still doesn't automatically switch themes, ensure that:
- For Expo your `app.json` contains a `userInterfaceStyle` key with the value `automatic`
- For bare React Native, your `Info.plist` does not have the `UIUserInterfaceStyle` key set to a hardcoded value
- `Appearance` from `react-native` is set to `null`
- You have phone with iOS 13+ or Android 10+
- Your device supports dark mode

### I'm getting some TypeScript error for my stylesheet

This should not occur, but if it does, please create a new issue in the GitHub repository.

Unistyles is built with first-class support for TypeScript, inferring all the types for you. 
There should be no need for extra steps. Please include your stylesheet and the error you're encountering in the issue.

### Does Unistyles support PlatformColor?

Yes, it does! You can even use PlatformColor in your themes!

### Are class components supported?

No, the library only supports functional components. 
If you need support for class components, you would need to create a wrapper component.

### How to use Unistyles with Expo?

Unistyles supports Expo. However, it can't be used with Expo Go.
