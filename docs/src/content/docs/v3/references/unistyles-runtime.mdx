import { Card } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

Unistyles Runtime is a powerful feature that allows you to access platform specific values directly from `JavaScript`.
It allows you to skip many dependencies and keep a lot of functionality under one object.

### Usage

You can import `UnistylesRuntime` from `react-native-unistyles`:

```tsx /UnistylesRuntime/
import { UnistylesRuntime } from 'react-native-unistyles'
```

and use it anywhere in your code, even outside a React component.

### Available getters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ----| ---- | ----------- |
| colorScheme | string | Get your device's color scheme. Available options `dark`, `light` or `unspecified` |
| hasAdaptiveThemes | boolean | Indicates if you have enabled [adaptive themes](/v3/guides/theming#adaptive-themes) |
| themeName | string? | Name of the selected theme or `undefined` if you haven't register any theme |
| breakpoint | string? | Current breakpoint or undefined if you haven't registered any |
| breakpoints | Object | Your registered breakpoints |
| screen | \{width: number, height: number\} | Screen dimensions |
| isPortrait | boolean | Indicates if your device is in portrait mode |
| isLandscape | boolean | Indicates if your device is in landscape mode |
| contentSizeCategory | IOSContentSizeCategory or AndroidContentSizeCategory | Your device's [content size category](/v3/references/content-size-category/) |
| insets | \{ top: number, bottom: number, left: number, right: number, ime: number \} | Device insets which are safe to put content into |
| statusBar | \{width: number, height: number\} | Status bar dimensions |
| navigationBar | \{width: number, height: number\} | Navigation bar dimensions (Android) |
| pixelRatio | number | Pixel density of the device |
| fontScale | number | Font scale of the device |
| rtl | boolean | Indicates if the device is in RTL mode |
| getTheme | (themeName?: string) => Theme | Get theme by name or current theme if not specified |

## Setters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ----| ---- | ----------- |
| setTheme | (themeName: string) => void | Change the current theme |
| setAdaptiveThemes | (enabled: boolean) => void | Toggle [adaptive themes](/v3/guides/theming#adaptive-themes) |
| updateTheme | (themeName: string, updater: (currentTheme: Theme) => Theme) => void | Update the [theme](/v3/guides/theming/#update-theme-during-runtime) at runtime |
| statusBar.setHidden | (hidden: boolean) => void | Show/hide status bar at runtime |

| setImmersiveMode | (enabled: boolean) => void | Enable/disable immersive mode (hiding both status and navigation bars) |
| setRootViewBackgroundColor | (color: string) => void | set root view background color |

### Why `UnistylesRuntime` doesn't re-render my component?

You should think of `UnistylesRuntime` as a JavaScript object.
It's not a React hook, so it doesn't re-render your component when eg. screen size or breakpoint changes.
Instead it will return up to date value whenever you access it.

### How to re-render my stylesheets based on `UnistylesRuntime`?

You can do that while accessing [miniRuntime](/v3/references/mini-runtime/) in your `StyleSheet`:

One example could be reading device width and height:

```tsx /runtime/
import { StyleSheet } from 'react-native-unistyles'

// your component

const style = StyleSheet.create((theme, rt) => ({
    container: {
        backgroundColor: theme.colors.background,
        width: rt.screen.width,
        height: rt.screen.height
    }
}))
```
