We’ve made Unistyles incredibly easy to use. You no longer need the `useStyle` hook or wrap your app in React Provider. Unistyles integrates seamlessly with your existing code, so you can start using it immediately.

### Prerequisites

Unistyles 3.0 is tightly integrated with `Fabric` and the latest versions of React Native. Therefore, you must use the **New Architecture** and at least **React Native 0.78.0**. Additionally, Unistyles relies on `react-native-nitro-modules` and `react-native-edge-to-edge`.

<Aside>Learn more about how Unistyles leverages Nitro Modules and React Native Edge to Edge [here](/v3/other/dependencies).</Aside>

**Table of requirements:**
|                    | Required                  | Note                        |
|--------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| React Native       | 0.78.0+                   |                             |
| New Architecture   | enabled                   | no option to opt-out        |
| Expo SDK           | 53+                       | (if you use Expo)           |
| Xcode              | 16+ (recommended 16.3+)   | Required by Nitro Modules   |
| Platform           | iOS / Android / Web / SSR | Follow instructions below |

Since Unistyles relies on `Fabric`, it cannot run on the `Old Architecture` or older versions of React Native. If you can’t meet these requirements, you can use Unistyles 2.0+, which is compatible with those versions.

### Installation

```shell title="Install Unistyles and its dependencies"
yarn add react-native-unistyles react-native-nitro-modules react-native-edge-to-edge
```

:::caution
To avoid unexpected behaviors always use a fixed version of `react-native-nitro-modules`.
Check compatibility table [here](https://github.com/jpudysz/react-native-unistyles?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
:::

Add babel plugin:

```js title="babel.config.js"
const path = require('path');
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true)

  return {
    // for bare React Native
    // presets: ['module:@react-native/babel-preset'],

    // or for Expo
    // presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],

    // other config
    plugins: [
        // other plugins
        ['react-native-unistyles/plugin', {
            // pass root folder of your application
            // all files under this folder will be processed by the Babel plugin
            // if you need to include more folders, or customize discovery process
            // check available babel options
            root: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src')
        }]
    ]
  }
}
```

<Aside>
See additional Babel plugin configuration options [here](/v3/other/babel-plugin#extra-configuration).

### As easy as React Native StyleSheet

Getting started with Unistyles couldn’t be easier. Simply replace React Native’s `StyleSheet` with the `StyleSheet` exported from Unistyles. From that moment, you’ll be using a `StyleSheet` with superpowers 🦸🏼‍♂️.

```diff lang="tsx" title="Example.tsx"
- import { StyleSheet } from 'react-native'
+ import { StyleSheet } from 'react-native-unistyles'

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Hello world from Unistyles</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
   container: {
     backgroundColor: 'red'
   }
})
```

By replacing `StyleSheet`, you immediately gain several benefits that aren’t available in React Native’s `StyleSheet`:

- [Variants](/v3/references/variants)
- [Compound variants](/v3/references/compound-variants)
- [Dynamic functions](/v3/references/dynamic-functions)
- [Media queries](/v3/references/media-queries)
- [Horizontal and vertical breakpoints for Native](/v3/references/breakpoints#built-in-breakpoints-landscape-and-portrait)
- [Custom web styles](/v3/references/web-styles)
- [Web only features](/v3/references/web-only)

When you're ready to customize your styles and unlock additional features you can [configure](/v3/start/configuration) Unistyles.
