description: How to use Unistyles 3.0 in your library
---

import { Card } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

Unistyles is highly extensible and can be used to build UI kits and various other projects. We maintain the core, so you can create any abstraction on top of it.

## Using Unistyles in your library

`StyleSheet.configure` should be invoked as soon as possible, before the metro bundler references any `StyleSheet` from your library.

You can then call `StyleSheet.configure` multiple times to override configurations.
However, keep in mind that `StyleSheet.configure` makes a roundtrip to C++, which can add a few `ms` to your app's startup time.

To manipulate your config without replacing it, use [UnistylesRuntime](/v3/references/unistyles-runtime/).

## Unistyles never re-renders

Unistyles' C++ core ensures that your components never re-render. Instead, they are updated directly from C++ and `Shadow Tree`.

## No React Context - no additional setup

Unistyles does not use the React Context API. This means that users do not need to wrap their app with a `Provider`,
reducing boilerplate code and making your library more user-friendly.

## New architecture only

Unistyles does not export any code that re-renders your components. While it requires enabling the New Architecture, we believe this trade-off is worthwhile, as more apps are expected to transition to the New Architecture in the coming months.

## Minimum requirements

Unistyles is compatible with:
- React Native version >=0.76
- TypeScript >5.0
- iOS 15.0+
- Android 7+

## Out of the box support for Web

Building a UI kit for both React Native and Web couldn’t be easier. Unistyles automatically manages your styles and converts them into CSS classes.

## Why to choose Unistyles?

Unistyles offers a unique architecture unavailable in any other library. Fully compatible with the React Native StyleSheet API, it is easy to use and extend.

By avoiding component abstraction, Unistyles gives you the freedom to create your own. It supports various platforms and is designed to be easily extendable.
