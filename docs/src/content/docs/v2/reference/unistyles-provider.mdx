If you app has dozens of screens and hundereds of `useStyles` hooks, you can encounter some performance issues and delays eg. when changing the theme.

To solve this problem, Unistyles 2.20.0 introduces a new component called `UnistylesProvider`.

### Usage

In order to use `UnistylesProvider`, you just need to wrap your app with it:

```diff lang="tsx"
import { UnistylesProvider } from 'react-native-unistyles'

export const App: React.FunctionComponent = () => (
+    <UnistylesProvider>
        <YourApp />
+    </UnistylesProvider>
)
```

This line of code will cancel all subscriptions from your `useStyles` hooks and switch the source of truth to the `UnistylesProvider`.

### How fast is it?

Re-rendering 1000 boxes with 1000 useStyles hooks (dev mode):

| Version | Time |
| --- | --- |
| with Provider | ~700 ms |
| without Provider | ~4.5 seconds! |

**It can speed your app up to x6-7 times!**

:::caution
This feature is not enabled by default, due to breaking changes in the default behavior of `useStyles`.
